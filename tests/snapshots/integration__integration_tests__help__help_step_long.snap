Individual workflow steps for scripting and automation. Each subcommand performs one step of the [2mwt merge[0m pipeline — commit, squash, rebase, push, or run hooks — allowing custom workflows or manual intervention between steps.

[32mExamples[0m

Commit with an LLM-generated message:

  [2mwt step commit[0m

Squash all branch commits into one:

  [2mwt step squash[0m

Run pre-merge hooks (tests, lints):

  [2mwt step pre-merge[0m

Rebase onto main:

  [2mwt step rebase[0m

[32mUse Cases[0m

[1mCustom merge workflow[0m — Run steps individually when [2mwt merge[0m doesn't fit, such as adding manual review between squash and rebase:

  [2mwt step commit[0m
  [2mwt step squash[0m
  [2m# manual review here[0m
  [2mwt step rebase[0m
  [2mwt step pre-merge[0m
  [2mwt step push[0m

[1mCI integration[0m — Run hooks explicitly in CI environments:

  [2mwt step pre-merge --force  # skip approval prompts[0m
