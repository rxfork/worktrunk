[32mOperation[0m

Removes worktree directory, git metadata, and branch. Requires clean working tree.

### No arguments (remove current)

- Removes current worktree and switches to main worktree
- In main worktree: switches to default branch

### By name (remove specific)

- Removes specified worktree(s) and branches
- Current worktree removed last (switches to main first)

### Background removal (default)

- Returns immediately so you can continue working
- Logs: [2m.git/wt-logs/{branch}-remove.log[0m
- Use [2m--no-background[0m for foreground (blocking)

### Cleanup

Stops any git fsmonitor daemon for the worktree before removal. This prevents orphaned processes when using builtin fsmonitor ([2mcore.fsmonitor=true[0m). No effect on Watchman users.
