wt switch - Switch to a worktree

Usage: [1m[36mwt switch[0m [36m[OPTIONS][0m [36m<BRANCH>

[1m[32mArguments:
  [36m<BRANCH>
          Branch or worktree name
          
          Shortcuts: '^' (main), '-' (previous), '@' (current)

[1m[32mOptions:
  [1m[36m-c[0m, [1m[36m--create
          Create a new branch

  [1m[36m-b[0m, [1m[36m--base[0m[36m [0m[36m<BASE>
          Base branch
          
          Defaults to default branch.

  [1m[36m-x[0m, [1m[36m--execute[0m[36m [0m[36m<EXECUTE>
          Command to run after switch
          
          Replaces the wt process with the command after switching, giving it full terminal control. Useful for launching editors, AI agents, or other
          interactive tools.
          
          Especially useful in shell aliases to create a worktree and start working in one command:
          
            [1m[1malias wsc='wt switch --create --execute=claude'
          [0m
          Then [1mwsc feature-branch[0m creates the worktree and launches Claude Code.

  [1m[36m-f[0m, [1m[36m--force
          Skip approval prompts

      [1m[36m--clobber
          Remove stale paths at target

      [1m[36m--no-verify
          Skip hooks

  [1m[36m-h[0m, [1m[36m--help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')

[1m[32mGlobal Options:
  [1m[36m-C[0m[36m [0m[36m<path>
          Working directory for this command

      [1m[36m--config[0m[36m [0m[36m<path>
          User config file path

  [1m[36m-v[0m, [1m[36m--verbose
          Show commands and debug info

Change directory to a worktree, creating one if needed. Creating a worktree runs hooks.

[32mExamples

  [2mwt switch feature-auth           # Switch to worktree
  [2mwt switch -                      # Previous worktree (like cd -)
  [2mwt switch --create new-feature   # Create new branch and worktree
  [2mwt switch --create hotfix --base production

[32mCreating a branch

The [2m--create[0m flag creates a new branch from the [2m--base[0m branch (defaults to default branch). Without [2m--create[0m, the branch must already exist.

[32mCreating worktrees

If the branch already has a worktree, [2mwt switch[0m changes directories to it. Otherwise, it creates one.

When creating a worktree, worktrunk:

1. Creates worktree at configured path
2. Switches to new directory
3. Runs post-create hooks (blocking)
4. Spawns post-start hooks (background)

  [2mwt switch feature                        # Existing branch → creates worktree
  [2mwt switch --create feature               # New branch and worktree
  [2mwt switch --create fix --base release    # New branch from release
  [2mwt switch --create temp --no-verify      # Skip hooks

[32mShortcuts

   Shortcut            Meaning            
   ──────── ───────────────────────────── 
   ^        Default branch (main/master)  
   @        Current branch/worktree       
   -        Previous worktree (like cd -) 

  [2mwt switch -                      # Back to previous
  [2mwt switch ^                      # Main worktree
  [2mwt switch --create fix --base=@  # Branch from current HEAD
