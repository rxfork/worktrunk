Removes worktrees and their branches. Without arguments, removes the current worktree and returns to the main worktree.

[32mExamples[0m

Remove current worktree:

  [2mwt remove[0m

Remove specific worktrees:

  [2mwt remove feature-branch[0m
  [2mwt remove old-feature another-branch[0m

Keep the branch:

  [2mwt remove --no-delete-branch feature-branch[0m

Force-delete an unmerged branch:

  [2mwt remove -D experimental[0m

[32mWhen Branches Are Deleted[0m

Branches delete automatically when their content is already in the target branch (typically main). This works with squash-merge and rebase workflows where commit history differs but file changes match.

Use [2m-D[0m to force-delete unmerged branches. Use [2m--no-delete-branch[0m to keep the branch.

[32mBackground Removal[0m

Removal runs in the background by default (returns immediately). Logs are written to [2m.git/wt-logs/{branch}-remove.log[0m. Use [2m--no-background[0m to run in the foreground.

[32mPath-First Lookup[0m

Arguments resolve by checking the expected path first, then falling back to branch name:

1. Compute expected path from argument (using configured path template)
2. If a worktree exists there, remove it (regardless of branch name)
3. Otherwise, treat argument as a branch name

If [2mrepo.foo/[0m exists on branch [2mbar[0m, both [2mwt remove foo[0m and [2mwt remove bar[0m remove the same worktree.

[1mShortcuts[0m: [2m@[0m (current), [2m-[0m (previous), [2m^[0m (main worktree)
