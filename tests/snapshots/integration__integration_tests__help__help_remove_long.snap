Removes worktrees and their branches. Without arguments, removes the current worktree and returns to the main worktree.

[32mExamples[0m

Remove current worktree:

  [2mwt remove[0m

Remove specific worktrees:

  [2mwt remove feature-branch[0m
  [2mwt remove old-feature another-branch[0m

Keep the branch:

  [2mwt remove --no-delete-branch feature-branch[0m

Force-delete an unmerged branch:

  [2mwt remove -D experimental[0m

[32mBranch cleanup[0m

Branches delete automatically when their content is already in the target branch (typically main). This works with squash-merge and rebase workflows where commit history differs but file changes match.

A branch is safe to delete when its content is already reflected in the target. Worktrunk checks three conditions:

1. [1mNo added changes[0m — Three-dot diff ([2mmain...branch[0m) shows no files. The branch has no file changes beyond the merge-base.
2. [1mTree contents match[0m — Branch tree SHA equals main tree SHA. Commit history differs but file contents are identical (e.g., after a revert or merge commit pulling in main).
3. [1mMerge adds nothing[0m — Simulated merge ([2mgit merge-tree[0m) produces the same tree as main. Handles squash-merged branches where main has since advanced.

In [2mwt list[0m, [2m_[0m indicates no commits ahead of main, and [2m≡[0m indicates tree contents match. Branches showing either are dimmed as safe to delete.

Use [2m-D[0m to force-delete branches with unmerged changes. Use [2m--no-delete-branch[0m to keep the branch regardless of status.

[32mBackground removal[0m

Removal runs in the background by default (returns immediately). Logs are written to [2m.git/wt-logs/{branch}-remove.log[0m. Use [2m--no-background[0m to run in the foreground.

Arguments resolve by path first, then branch name. Shortcuts: [2m@[0m (current), [2m-[0m (previous), [2m^[0m (main worktree).
