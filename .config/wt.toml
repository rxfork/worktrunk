#   {repo_root} - Path to the main repository root
# Seed target/ from base worktree using CoW (copy-on-write)
# Each worktree gets its own target/ (avoids incremental build corruption)
# but seeded from base to warm-start builds (low disk usage)
# macOS: uses cp -c (clonefile on APFS)
# Linux: would need cp --reflink=auto (GNU coreutils) or rsync 3.2.3+ with --reflink
