# IMPORTANT: When running in background process groups (AI coding environments
# like Codex/Claude Code, or nested tmux/screen sessions), nextest's InputHandler
# can receive SIGTTOU when restoring terminal settings, causing process suspension.
#
# Solution: Run with NEXTEST_NO_INPUT_HANDLER=1 or use the pre-merge hook which
# sets this automatically:
#
#   NEXTEST_NO_INPUT_HANDLER=1 cargo nextest run --features shell-integration-tests
#
# Or use `cargo test` which doesn't have this issue:
#
#   cargo test --test integration --features shell-integration-tests
#
# See tests/common/mod.rs for details on the SIGTTOU issue.

# The ci_status tests spawn many parallel threads and processes (~30 threads, ~34
# child processes each). Mark them as "heavy" so nextest limits how many run
# concurrently. threads-required=4 means on an 8-core machine, only 2 of these
# tests run at once instead of 8.
