Worktrunk is a CLI for git worktree management, designed for parallel AI agent
workflows. Git worktrees give each agent an isolated branch and directory;
Worktrunk wraps them in a clean interface, plus hooks to extend. Scaling agents
becomes as simple as scaling git branches.

Here's a quick demo:

## Context: git worktrees

AI agents like Claude Code and Codex can handle longer tasks without
supervision, such that it's possible to manage 5-10+ in parallel. Git worktrees
give each agent its own working directory; no stepping on each other's changes.

But the git worktree UX is clunky. Even a task as simple as starting a new
worktree requires typing the branch name three times: `git worktree add -b feat
../repo.feat`, then `cd ../repo.feat`.

## Worktrunk makes git worktrees simple

Start with the core commands; add workflow automation as needed.

**Core commands:**

<table class="cmd-compare">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Task</th>
      <th>Worktrunk</th>
      <th>Plain git</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Switch worktrees</td>
      <td><code>wt switch feat</code></td>
      <td>{% rawcode() %}cd ../repo.feat{% end %}</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Create + start Claude</td>
      <td><code>wt switch -c -x claude feat</code></td>
      <td>{% rawcode() %}git worktree add -b feat ../repo.feat && \
cd ../repo.feat && \
claude{% end %}</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Clean up</td>
      <td><code>wt remove</code></td>
      <td>{% rawcode() %}cd ../repo && \
git worktree remove ../repo.feat && \
git branch -d feat{% end %}</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>List with status</td>
      <td><code>wt list</code></td>
      <td>{% rawcode() %}git worktree list{% end %} (paths only)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

**Workflow automation:**

- **[Lifecycle hooks](@/hook.md)** — run commands on create, pre-merge, post-merge
- **[LLM commit messages](@/llm-commits.md)** — generate commit messages from diffs via [llm](https://llm.datasette.io/)
- **[Merge workflow](@/merge.md)** — squash, rebase, merge, clean up in one command
- ...and **[lots more](#next-steps)**

## Install

**Homebrew (macOS & Linux):**

```bash
$ brew install max-sixty/worktrunk/wt
$ wt config shell install  # allows commands to change directories
```

**Cargo:**

```bash
$ cargo install worktrunk
$ wt config shell install
```

## Next steps

- Learn the core commands: [wt switch](@/switch.md), [wt list](@/list.md), [wt merge](@/merge.md), [wt remove](@/remove.md)
- Set up [project hooks](@/hook.md) for automated setup
- Explore [LLM commit messages](@/llm-commits.md), [fzf-like
  selector](@/select.md), [Claude Code integration](@/claude-code.md), [CI
  status & PR links](@/list.md#ci-status)
- Run `wt --help` or `wt <command> --help` for quick CLI reference
