Removes worktrees and their branches. Without arguments, removes the current worktree and returns to the main worktree.

## Examples

Remove current worktree:

```bash
wt remove
```

Remove specific worktrees:

```bash
wt remove feature-branch
wt remove old-feature another-branch
```

Keep the branch:

```bash
wt remove --no-delete-branch feature-branch
```

Force-delete an unmerged branch:

```bash
wt remove -D experimental
```

## When Branches Are Deleted

Branches delete automatically when their content is already in the target branch (typically main). This works with squash-merge and rebase workflows where commit history differs but file changes match.

Use `-D` to force-delete unmerged branches. Use `--no-delete-branch` to keep the branch.

## Background Removal

Removal runs in the background by default (returns immediately). Logs are written to `.git/wt-logs/{branch}-remove.log`. Use `--no-background` to run in the foreground.

## Path-First Lookup

Arguments resolve by checking the expected path first, then falling back to branch name:

1. Compute expected path from argument (using configured path template)
2. If a worktree exists there, remove it (regardless of branch name)
3. Otherwise, treat argument as a branch name

If `repo.foo/` exists on branch `bar`, both `wt remove foo` and `wt remove bar` remove the same worktree.

**Shortcuts**: `@` (current), `-` (previous), `^` (main worktree)
