Run individual workflow operations: commits, squashes, rebases, pushes, and [hooks](/hooks/).

## Examples

Commit with LLM-generated message:

```bash
wt step commit
```

Run pre-merge hooks in CI:

```bash
wt step pre-merge --force
```

Manual merge workflow with review between steps:

```bash
wt step commit
wt step squash
# Review the squashed commit
wt step rebase
wt step push
```

## Operations

**Git operations:**

- `commit` — Stage and commit with [LLM-generated message](/llm-commits/)
- `squash` — Squash all branch commits into one with [LLM-generated message](/llm-commits/)
- `rebase` — Rebase onto target branch
- `push` — Push to target branch (default: main)

**Hooks** — run project commands defined in [`.config/wt.toml`](/hooks/):

- `post-create` — After worktree creation
- `post-start` — After switching to a worktree
- `pre-commit` — Before committing
- `pre-merge` — Before pushing to target
- `post-merge` — After merge cleanup

## See Also

- [wt merge](/merge/) — Runs commit → squash → rebase → hooks → push → cleanup automatically
