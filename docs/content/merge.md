Merge the current branch into the target branch and clean up. Handles the full workflow: commit uncommitted changes, squash commits, rebase, run hooks, push to target, and remove the worktree.

When already on the target branch or in the main worktree, the worktree is preserved automatically.

## Examples

Basic merge to main:

```bash
wt merge
```

Keep the worktree after merging:

```bash
wt merge --no-remove
```

Preserve commit history (no squash):

```bash
wt merge --no-squash
```

Skip git operations, only run hooks and push:

```bash
wt merge --no-commit
```

## Pipeline

`wt merge` runs these steps:

1. **Commit** — Stages and commits uncommitted changes. Commit messages are LLM-generated. Use `--stage` to control what gets staged: `all` (default), `tracked`, or `none`.

2. **Squash** — Combines all commits into one (like GitHub's "Squash and merge"). Skip with `--no-squash` to preserve individual commits. A backup ref is saved to `refs/wt-backup/<branch>`.

3. **Rebase** — Rebases onto the target branch. Conflicts abort immediately.

4. **Pre-merge hooks** — Project commands run after rebase, before push. Failures abort. See [Hooks](/hooks/).

5. **Push** — Fast-forward push to the target branch. Non-fast-forward pushes are rejected.

6. **Cleanup** — Removes the worktree and branch. Use `--no-remove` to keep the worktree.

7. **Post-merge hooks** — Project commands run after cleanup. Failures are logged but don't abort.

Use `--no-commit` to skip steps 1-3 and only run hooks and push. Requires a clean working tree and `--no-remove`.
