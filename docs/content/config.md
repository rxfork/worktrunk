Manages configuration, shell integration, and runtime settings. The command provides subcommands for setup, inspection, and cache management.

## Examples

Install shell integration (required for directory switching):

```bash
wt config shell install
```

Create user config file with documented examples:

```bash
wt config create
```

Show current configuration and file locations:

```bash
wt config show
```

## Shell Integration

Shell integration allows Worktrunk to change the shell's working directory after `wt switch`. Without it, commands run in a subprocess and directory changes don't persist.

The `wt config shell install` command adds integration to the shell's config file. Manual installation:

```bash
# For bash: add to ~/.bashrc
eval "$(wt config shell init bash)"

# For zsh: add to ~/.zshrc
eval "$(wt config shell init zsh)"

# For fish: add to ~/.config/fish/config.fish
wt config shell init fish | source
```

## Configuration Files

**User config** — `~/.config/worktrunk/config.toml` (or `$WORKTRUNK_CONFIG_PATH`):

Personal settings like LLM commit generation, path templates, and default behaviors. The `wt config create` command generates a file with documented examples.

**Project config** — `.config/wt.toml` in repository root:

Project-specific hooks: post-create, post-start, pre-commit, pre-merge, post-merge. See [Hooks](/hooks/) for details.

## LLM Commit Messages

Worktrunk can generate commit messages using an LLM. Enable in user config:

```toml
[commit-generation]
command = "llm"
```

See [LLM Commits](/llm-commits/) for installation, provider setup, and customization.
