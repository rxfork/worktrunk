    #[command(after_help = "\
BEHAVIOR:

Switching to Existing Worktree:
  - If worktree exists for branch, changes directory to it
  - No hooks run
  - No branch creation

Creating New Worktree (--create):
  1. Creates new branch (defaults to current default branch as base)
  2. Creates worktree in parallel directory (../<branch>)
  3. Runs post-create hooks sequentially (blocking)
  4. Shows success message
  5. Spawns post-start hooks in background (non-blocking)
  6. Changes directory to new worktree

HOOKS:

post-create (sequential, blocking):
  - Run after worktree creation, before success message
  - Typically: npm install, cargo build, setup tasks
  - Failures block the operation
  - Skip with --no-verify

post-start (parallel, background):
  - Spawned after success message shown
  - Typically: dev servers, file watchers, editors
  - Run in background, failures logged but don't block
  - Skip with --no-verify

EXAMPLES:

Switch to existing worktree:
  wt switch feature-branch

Create new worktree from main:
  wt switch --create new-feature

Switch to previous worktree:
  wt switch -

Create from specific base:
  wt switch --create hotfix --base production

Create and run command:
  wt switch --create docs --execute \"code .\"

Skip hooks during creation:
  wt switch --create temp --no-verify")]
    Switch {
        /// Branch name, worktree path, '@' for current HEAD, or '-' for previous branch
        branch: String,

        /// Create a new branch
        #[arg(short = 'c', long)]
        create: bool,

        /// Base branch to create from (only with --create). Use '@' for current HEAD
        #[arg(short = 'b', long)]
        base: Option<String>,

        /// Execute command after switching
        #[arg(short = 'x', long)]
        execute: Option<String>,

        /// Skip confirmation prompt
        #[arg(short = 'f', long)]
        force: bool,

        /// Skip all project hooks (post-create, post-start)
        #[arg(long)]
        no_verify: bool,
    },

    /// Finish current worktree, returning to primary if current
    #[command(after_help = "\
BEHAVIOR:

Remove Current Worktree (no arguments):
  - Requires clean working tree (no uncommitted changes)
  - If in worktree: removes it and switches to primary worktree
  - If in primary worktree: switches to default branch (e.g., main)
  - If already on default branch in primary: does nothing

Remove Specific Worktree (by name):
  - Requires target worktree has clean working tree
  - Removes specified worktree(s) and associated branches
  - If removing current worktree, switches to primary first
  - Can remove multiple worktrees in one command

Remove Multiple Worktrees:
  - When removing multiple, current worktree is removed last
  - Prevents deleting directory you're currently in
  - Each worktree must have clean working tree

CLEANUP:

When removing a worktree (by default):
  1. Validates worktree has no uncommitted changes
  2. Changes directory (if removing current worktree)
  3. Deletes worktree directory
  4. Removes git worktree metadata
  5. Deletes associated branch (uses git branch -d, safe delete)
     - If branch has unmerged commits, shows warning but continues
     - Use --no-delete-branch to skip branch deletion

EXAMPLES:

Remove current worktree and branch:
  wt remove

Remove specific worktree and branch:
  wt remove feature-branch

Remove worktree but keep branch:
  wt remove --no-delete-branch feature-branch

Remove multiple worktrees:
  wt remove old-feature another-branch

Switch to default in primary:
  wt remove  # (when already in primary worktree)")]
    Remove {
        /// Worktree names or branches to remove (use '@' for current, defaults to current if none specified)
        worktrees: Vec<String>,

        /// Don't delete the branch after removing the worktree (by default, branches are deleted)
        #[arg(long = "no-delete-branch")]
        no_delete_branch: bool,
    },

    /// Merge worktree into target branch
    #[command(long_about = "Merge worktree into target branch

LIFECYCLE

The merge operation follows a strict order designed for fail-fast execution:

1. Validate branches
   Verifies current branch exists (not detached HEAD) and determines target branch
   (defaults to repository's default branch).

2. Auto-commit uncommitted changes
   If working tree has uncommitted changes, stages all changes (git add -A) and commits
   with LLM-generated message.

3. Squash commits (default)
   By default, counts commits since merge base with target branch. When multiple
   commits exist, squashes them into one with LLM-generated message. Skip squashing
   with --no-squash.

4. Rebase onto target
   Rebases current branch onto target branch. Detects conflicts and aborts if found.
   This fails fast before running expensive checks.

5. Run pre-merge commands
   Runs commands from project config's [pre-merge-command] after rebase completes.
   These receive {target} placeholder for the target branch. Commands run sequentially
   and any failure aborts the merge immediately. Skip with --no-verify.

6. Push to target
   Fast-forward pushes to target branch. Rejects non-fast-forward pushes (ensures
   linear history).

7. Clean up worktree and branch
   Removes current worktree, deletes the branch, and switches primary worktree to target
   branch if needed. Skip removal with --no-remove.

EXAMPLES

Basic merge to main:
  wt merge

Merge without squashing:
  wt merge --no-squash

Keep worktree after merging:
  wt merge --no-remove

Skip pre-merge commands:
  wt merge --no-verify")]
